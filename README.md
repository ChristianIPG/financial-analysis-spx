Analysis and predictions of the S&P 500 Index performance.

## Project Description
The following project observes historical data on the S&P 500 stock market index, one of the most globally important equity indices including approximately 80% of the total market capitalization of U.S. public companies.

The analysis, performed entirely using Python, focuses on observing historical data on daily SPX prices for the last 4 decades, and apply Statistical measures to predict future behaviour with a reasonable level of accuracy, despite the well-known unpredictability of financial markets.

We will observe the distribution of the daily Closing prices, perform some Technical Analysis such as calculating the Moving Averages with Python, some calculations of probabilities of specific price changes at specific confidence intervals, some calculations such as the Value at Risk, we'll also test hypothesis on the returns of investment, develop and evaluate some investing strategies. Finally we'll also build a linear regression model to explain the movements of the index.

## Data
The data used in this project contains daily prices of the S&P 500 Index from the years 1983 to 2023.

The data is found in .csv format, provided in the file INDEXSP500.csv. We'll mostly look at the daily close price. Some minor transformations will be performed.
