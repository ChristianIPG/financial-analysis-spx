Analysis and predictions of the S&P 500 Index performance.

## Project Description
The following project observes historical data on the S&P 500 stock market index, one of the most globally important equity indices including approximately 80% of the total market capitalization of U.S. public companies.

We observe the distribution of the daily Closing prices, we will perform some Technical Analysis such as calculating the Moving Averages with Python, some calculations of probabilities of specific price changes at specific confidence intervals, calculations such as the Value at Risk, we'll test hypothesis on the returns of investment and develop linear regression model to explain the movements of the index. 

## Data
